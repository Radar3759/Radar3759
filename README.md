- 👋 Hi, I’m @Radar3759, a Full Stack bootcamp grad. I had a not great bootcamp experience in 2019/2020 and have been self learning since then with several sources. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I need to know more about tech vocabulary so I can ask questions more effectively
- 📫 How to reach me ...https://www.linkedin.com/in/c-lacefield-0889031b1/
